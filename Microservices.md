### :red_circle:what is Microservice?
Microservices are independently **deployable** services modeled around a business
domain. They communicate with each other via **networks**, and as an architecture
choice offer many options for solving the problems you may face. It follows that a
microservice architecture is based on multiple collaborating microservices.

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. Its principles are independent of vendors and other technologies. In[ **service oriented architecture**](http://santexgroup.com/), a number of services communicate with each other, in one of two ways: through passing data or through two or more services coordinating an activity. This is just one definition of Service-Oriented Architecture.
